## An Investigation of Machine Learning Algorithms and Data Augmentation Techniques for Diabetes Diagnosis Using Class Imbalanced BRFSS Dataset


In the project folder, you'll find:

1. A 'Data' folder with the preprocessed dataset.
2. A sample Code titled 'diabetes_ml_brfss.ipynb' and sample fine-tuned hyper parameter file 'grid_search_hyper_parameter.xlsx' for the undersampling technique Edited Nearest Neighbor is available.

## To use this project:

Copy it to your computer.
Look inside the folders for the specific files you need.
Use a program like Jupyter Notebook or Python to run the code.

Upon reasonable request, more files will be provided. From the paper.
Thank you.
